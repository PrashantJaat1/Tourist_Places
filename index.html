          <h3>Red Fort In Delhi</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors.
             Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi.
             The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble 
             structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged,
              and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.</p>

            <h3>Taj Mahal in Agra</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares,
                 in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with 
                 construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, 
                 the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and 
                 Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, 
                 masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from
                  the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.

            <h3>Lohagarh Fort, Bharatpu</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
               Lohagarh Fort (or Iron Fort) is situated at Bharatpur in Rajasthan, India.[1] It was constructed by Bharatpur Jat rulers.
                Maharaja Suraj Mal (1755-1763 CE) built numerous forts and palaces across his kingdom, one of them being the Lohagarh Fort,
                 one of the strongest ever built in Indian history. The inaccessible Lohagarh fort could withstand repeated attacks of British 
                 forces led by Lord Lake during the siege of Bharatpur in 1805 when they laid siege for over six weeks yet failed in all four
                  attempts to storm the fortress.[2]

                Of the two gates in the fort, the one in the north is known as Ashtdhaatu (eight metalled) gate while the one facing the south
                 is called Chowburja (four-pillared) gate. Monuments in the fort include are Kishori Mahal, Mahal Khas, and Kothi Khas.
              Jawahar Burj was built by Raja Jawahar Singh in 1765 to commemorate his victory over Mughals at Battle of Delhi (1764).
               Jawahar Burj was also used for the coronation ceremony of the rulers. Fateh Burj was built by Raja Ranjeet Singh in 1805
                for the commemoration of his win over the British at the Siege of Bharatpur (1805).[3]

            <hr>
            <p>
                Amer Fort or Amber Fort is a fort located in Amer, Rajasthan, India. Amer is a town with an area of 4 square kilometres
                 (1.5 sq mi)[1] located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. The town of Amer and the Amber 
                 Fort were originally built by Raja Man Singh and additions were, later, made by Sawai Jai Singh. Located high on a hill, 
                 it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur.[2][3] Amer Fort is known for its artistic style elements. 
                 With its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks Maota Lake,
                 [3][4][5][6] which is the main source of water for the Amer Palace.

                Amer Palace is great example of Rajput architecture. Some of its buildings and work have influence of Mughal 
                architecture.[7][8][9] Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four
                 levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas,
                  or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool 
                  climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amer Fort 
                  is also popularly known as the Amer Palace.

            <h3>Part of Rajasthan</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone,
                 it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

                The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, 
                the founder of the city of Jaipur, India.[1] He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that
                 he built this grand and historical palace.
                
                It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows 
                called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original intent of the lattice design was to allow
                 royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen,
                  since they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah", which forbade them to appear in public without face coverings. 
                  This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area 
                  more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.[2][3][4] Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view 
                  and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back.</p>

                Mehrangarh Fort covers an area of 1,200 acres (486 hectares) in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. 
                The complex is located on a hilltop around 122 metres above the surrounding plain,[1] and was constructed circa 1459
                 by Rajput ruler Rao Jodha, though most of the existing structure is from the 17th century. Inside its boundaries
                  there are several palaces known for their intricate carvings and expansive courtyards, as well as a museum housing
                   various relics. A winding road leads to and from the city below. The imprints of the impact of cannonballs fired by
                    attacking armies of Jaipur can still be seen on the second gate. At the north-east of the fort is the chhatri of
                     Kirat Singh Soda, a soldier who fell on the spot defending Mehrangarh.

                There are seven gates, which include Jai Pol (meaning victory gate), built by Maharaja Man Singh to commemorate
                 his victories over the Jaipur and Bikaner armies in 1806. The Fattehpol (also meaning 'victory gate'), 
                 commemorates victory of Maharaja Ajit Singh over the Mughals.

                 Some of the notable festivals taking place here include the World Sacred Spirit Festival and 
                 Rajasthan International Folk Festival

                The Jal Mahal palace is an architectural showcase of the Rajput style of architecture (common in Rajasthan)
                 on a grand scale. The building has a picturesque view of Man Sagar Lake, but owing to its seclusion from land is
                  equally the focus of a viewpoint from the Man Sagar Dam on the eastern side of the lake in front of the backdrop 
                  of the surrounding Nahargarh ("tiger-abode") hills. The palace, built in red sandstone, is a five-storied building,
                   of which four floors remain underwater when the lake is full and the top floor is exposed[citation needed].
                   [1] One rectangular Chhatri on the roof is of the Bengal type. The chhatris on the four corners are octagonal. 
                   The palace had suffered subsidence in the past and also partial seepage (plaster work and wall damage equivalent
                    to rising damp) because of water logging, which have been repaired under a restoration project of the Government of Rajasthan.[2]

                The hills surrounding the lake area, towards the north east of Jaipur, have quartzite rock formations (with a thin 
                layer of soil cover), which is part of the Aravalli hills range. Rock exposures on the surface in some parts of the

            <hr>
            <p >
                The Shree Jagannatha Temple is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Jagannatha, a form of Vishnu - one of the trinity 
                of supreme divinity in Hinduism, Located in Puri in the state of Odisha on the eastern coast of India. 
                The present temple was rebuilt from the 10th century onwards, on the site of pre existing temples in the 
                compound but not the main Shree Jagannatha temple, and begun by Anantabarman Chodaganga, the first king of 
                the Eastern Ganga dynasty.[1]

            The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra,[2] or chariot festival, in which the three principal deities
             are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars. Unlike the stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples,
              the image of Jagannatha (which gave its name to the English term 'juggernaut') is made of wood and is ceremoniously 
              replaced every twelve or 19 years by an exact replica.[3] It is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites
